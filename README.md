# Company Website

## A test website project

This project serves as a first attempt at web development and is only practice. Its goals:

* To create a website for a company
* To highlight the best about the company 
* To look as professional as possible

Work in progress / known issues:
* The contact form currently only serves as a test
* The hamburger menu does not stick to the header on the contact page
* Descriptions and styling must be improved

The website neither has formal affiliation with the company it is about, nor does it a formally represent it.
