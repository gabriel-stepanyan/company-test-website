# Satria Website

## A test website project for the furniture company Satria

This project is my first stab at web development. Its goals:

* To create a website for a company
* To highlight the best about the company 
* To look as professional as possible

Work in progress / known issues:
* The contact form currently only serves as a test
* The hamburger menu does not stick to the header on the contact page
* Descriptions must be improved
* Styling is to be improved
